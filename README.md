# digital-gypsy-app
An app for digital gypsies to discover awesome new places to work.

Our client, Nomadlist has called upon a wonderful group of developers to help implement some new features in their website. Features to be added are as follows:

- User authentication system 
- The ability to save city options
- The ability to add details to that city option (to assist with planning etc)
- A google map with points on the saved locations to show the user their potential new locations on a map

## User Story:
- As a user, you will be able to search for locations that you would be interested in working/living by using filter options. Search by month you wish to go, preferred weather during that month and by budget to get options.
- After the results are rendered the user can choose to save these options and add notes to the entries if they wish.
-User will be able to see all of their saved locations on a google map with points.
